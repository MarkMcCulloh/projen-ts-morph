# projen-ts-morph

Generate and navigate typescript files with a [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) component.

## Implementation
The sole exported class of this project, `TypescriptMorpher`, acts as a wrapper around the excellent [ts-morph](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph/tree/latest/packages/ts-morph).

A few convenience methods are added to that class to aid in codegen, and during the synth() phase of your project all creations/updates/deletes will be saved to disk.

See https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph and https://ts-morph.com for more details on the API. I take no credit for that amazing project.

## Gettings Started

Make sure to add `ts-morph` as a dependency and make sure it's actually installed before attempting to use this component. See examples below to get started.

## Stability

Consider this library unstable.

## Examples

### Create an example snippet for your README

See [this project's .projenrc.ts](./.projenrc.ts#L31) for usage of `createTemporaryTypescriptFile` and `renderFencedTypescript`

### Create a simple empty class

```typescript
import { TypescriptMorpher } from 'projen-ts-morph';
const morpher = new TypescriptMorpher(project);
const source = morpher.createTypescriptFile('src/cool_generated.ts');
source.addClass({
    name: 'CoolGenerated',
    isDefaultExport: true,
});
```

It is so unnecessary to use projen for this readme, but here I go anyways :)
